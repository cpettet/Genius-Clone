She don't like her eggs all runny<br />
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny<br />
She looks down her nose at money<br />
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny<br />
She's my baby, I'm her honey<br />
I'm never gonna let her go<br /><br />

[Verse 2: Iris Dement]<br />
He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays<br />
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies<br />
He ain't too sharp, but he gets things done<br />
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen<br />
He's my baby and I'm his honey<br />
I'm never gonna let him go<br /><br />

[Chorus: Both]<br />
In spite of ourselves, we'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow<br />
Against all odds, honey, we're the big door prize<br />
We're gonna spite our noses right off of our faces<br />
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes<br /><br />

[Verse 3: John Prine]<br />
She thinks all my jokes are corny<br />
Convict movies make her horny<br />
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs<br />
Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs<br />
She takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'<br />
I'm never gonna let her go<br /><br />


[Verse 4: Iris Dement]<br />
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey<br />
He's a whacked-out weirdo and a lovebug junkie<br />
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon<br />
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon<br />
He's my baby, I don't mean maybe<br />
Never gonna let him go<br /><br />

In spite of ourselves, we'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow<br />

I hate to wake you up to say goodbye<br />

The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn<br />
Already I'm so lonesome I could die<br /><br />

So kiss me and smile for me<br />
Tell me that you'll wait for me<br />

Don't know when I'll be back again<br />
Oh babe, I hate to go<br /><br />

There's so many times I've let you down<br />
So many times I've played around<br />
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing<br />
Every place I go, I'll think of you<br />
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you<br />
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring<br /><br />

Tell me that you'll wait for me<br />

Oh babe, I hate to go<br />

[Verse 3]<br /><br />
Now the time has come to leave you<br />
One more time, let me kiss you<br />
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way<br />
Dream about the days to come<br />
When I won't have to leave alone<br />
About the times I won't have to say<br /><br />

Kiss me and smile for me<br />

Day is Qumran<br />
Everything that happens is from now on<br />

I keep throwing it down, two<br />
Hundred at a time<br />
It's hard to find it when you knew it<br />
When your money's gone<br />
And you're drunk as hell<br />
<br />
On your back with your racks as he stacks your load<br />
In the back with the racks and he stacks your load<br />
In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load<br />
<br />
I've been twisting to the sun<br />
I needed to replace<br />
And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out<br />
All my love was down<br />
In a frozen ground<br />
<br />
There's a black crow sitting across from me<br />
His wiry legs are crossed<br />
He's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss<br />
Whatever could it be<br />
That has brought me to this loss?<br />
<br />
On your back with your racks as he stacks your load<br />
In the back with the racks and he stacks your load<br />
In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load<br />
<br />
This is not the sound of a new man<br />
Or a crispy realization<br />
It's the sound of me unlocking and you lift away<br />
Your love will be<br />
Safe with me<br />

Betty, I won't make assumptions<br />
About why you switched your homeroom, but<br />
I think it's 'cause of me<br />
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard<br />
When I passed your house<br />
It's like I couldn't breathe<br />

[Pre-Chorus]<br />
You heard the rumors from Inez<br />
You can't believe a word she says<br />
Most times, but this time it was true<br />
The worst thing that I ever did<br />
Was what I did to you<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
But if I just showed up at your party<br />
Would you have me? Would you want me?<br />
Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br />
Or lead me to the garden?<br />
In the garden, would you trust me<br />
If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br />
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything<br />
But I know I miss you<br />

[Verse 2]<br />
Betty, I know where it all went wrong<br />
Your favorite song was playing<br />
From the far side of the gym<br />
I was nowhere to be found<br />
I hate the crowds, you know that<br />
Plus, I saw you dance with him<br />

You heard the rumors from Inez<br />

[Bridge]<br />
I was walking home on broken cobblestones<br />
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like<br />
A figment of my worst intentions<br />
She said "James, get in, let's drive"<br />
Those days turned into nights<br />
Slept next to her, but<br />
I dreamt of you all summer long<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep<br />
And I planned it out for weeks now<br />
But it's finally sinkin' in<br />
Betty, right now is the last time<br />
I can dream about what happens when<br />
You see my face again<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
The only thing I wanna do<br />
Is make it up to you<br />
So I showed up at your party<br />
Yeah, I showed up at your party<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Yeah, I showed up at your party<br />
Will you have me? Will you love me?<br />
Will you kiss me on the porch<br />
In front of all your stupid friends?<br />
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?<br />
Will it patch your broken wings?<br />
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything<br />
But I know I miss you<br />
<br />
[Outro]<br />
Standing in your cardigan<br />
Kissin' in my car again<br />
Stopped at a streetlight<br />
You know I miss you<br />
